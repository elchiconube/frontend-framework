## Documentation
Framework to generate your style.css with nice arquitecture using atomic web design, sass and grunt. It works for every project it doesn't matter if you use Wordpress, Drupal, Symphony, Angular or whatever you want.

These framework is based on [Brad Frost's Atomic Design post](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)
Note: Files that begin with "_" are ignored even if they match the globbing pattern. This is done to match the expected Sass partial behaviour.

## Frontend Tecnologies
### Sass task
_Run this task with the `grunt sass` command._
[Sass](http://sass-lang.com) is a preprocessor that adds nested rules, variables, mixins and functions, selector inheritance, and more to CSS. Sass files compile into well-formatted, standard CSS to use in your site or application.

This task requires you to have [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/download.html) installed. If you're on OS X or Linux you probably already have Ruby installed; test with `ruby -v` in your terminal. When you've confirmed you have Ruby installed, run `gem install sass` to install Sass.

Note: Files that begin with "_" are ignored even if they match the globbing pattern. This is done to match the expected [Sass partial behaviour](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#partials).
